### A Collection of our Completed CVEXes
This static HUGO website serves as a database of completed CVEXes. These CVEXes were created by the Team of Professors Kruegel & Vigna, with 4 undergraduate researchers affiliated with UCSB's Early Research Scholars Program 2023-2024 cohort.

### What is a CVEX?
CVEX is an executable that runs a software exploit and outputs relevant data in the form of network traffic. Each CVEX is packaged in the form of a Docker container, which has the benefit of being convenient and compatible with any operating system. As a result, CVEXes can be run and analyzed by any person curious to understand the workings of a software vulnerability.
