**CVEX v2.0** was a collaborative effort from ERSP 2023-2024. 

It takes inspiration from past CVEXes created from the past years.
Using a similar `exploiter` vs `recorder` model, we've further divided our CVEs into 3 main
containers: `server`, `client`, and `listener` while also enabling `tcpdump` traffic files 
and stack traces to be stored in a user's local directory for better analysis of the exploit
