# CVEX: Common Vulnerability and Exposure Executable

This static HUGO website serves as a database of completed CVEXes. These CVEXes were created by Team Kruegel & Vigna, 4 undergraduate researchers affiliated with UCSB's Early Research Scholars Program 2023-2024 cohort.

Special thanks to Noah Spahn, Professor Giovanni Vigna, and Professor Christopher Kruegel, and UCSB SecLab.

# What is a CVEX?
CVEX is an executable that runs a software exploit and outputs relevant data in the form of network traffic. Each CVEX is packaged in the form of a Docker container, which has the benefit of being convenient and compatible with any operating system. As a result, CVEXes can be run and analyzed by any person curious to understand the workings of a software vulnerability.
